### INTRODUCTION To NLP

1. What is NLP :question:
  
  * Natural language processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that helps computers understand, interpret and manipulate human language.
  * NLP draws from many disciplines, including computer science and computational linguistics, in its pursuit to fill the gap between human communication and computer understanding.
  * NLP is automated way to understand and analyze natural human language and extract information from such data by applying machine learning algorithm.
  * Eg :- Google Assistant application , it takes questions from human that can be written and spoken and answer them accordingly

2. Why NLP :question:

  * Answering Questions:-Question answering (QA) is a computer science discipline within the fields of information retrieval and natural language processing (NLP), which is concerned with building systems that automatically answer questions posed by humans in a natural language.
  

  
  
  * Information Extraction:-Information extraction (IE) is the task of automatically extracting structured information from unstructured and/or semi-structured machine-readable documents and other electronically represented sources. In most of the cases this activity concerns processing human language texts by means of natural language processing (NLP). Recent activities in multimedia document processing like automatic annotation and content extraction out of images/audio/video/documents could be seen as information extraction 
    


 
  * Machine Translation :- Machine Translation (MT) is the task of automatically converting one natural language into another, preserving the meaning of the input text, and producing fluent text in the output language.
  


  
  
  * Text Summarization :- It is a technique that shortens a long piece of content with main points outlined that gives an idea of the whole content. It becomes critical when someone needs a quick and accurate summary of very long content. Summarizing text can be expensive and time-consuming if done manually.
    


  
  
  * Sentiment Analysis :- Sentiment analysis is the interpretation and classification of emotions (positive, negative and neutral) within text data using text analysis techniques. Sentiment analysis tools allow businesses to identify customer sentiment toward products, brands or services in online feedback.
